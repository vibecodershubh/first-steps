# This is my first project (hotel management system)
 The Hotel Management System is a user-friendly,
 interactive program designed to streamline the
 operations of a hotel. This system serves as a centralized
 platform to manage essential hotel activities such as
 room bookings, staff management, billing, and customer
 records. Built using Python and integrated with a MySQL
 database, the system provides an efficient way to handle
 day-to-day hotel operations, ensuring a seamless
 experience for both customers and hotel staff
